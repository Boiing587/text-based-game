# This is a retro 90s styled text based game I'm making purely in Python
 It runs entirely in the terminal, so there are some things you should keep in mind.
 1. I'm using a function that gradually displays text, letter by letter. There is also sleep delays, so avoid typing anything into the         terminal, until you get the prompt with the actions you can make. There is no way to work around that problem, so I'm warning you now.
 2. This is by far no perfect project, and I'm no professional either, so if you find anything that doesn't work correctly, feel free to       let me know, and I'll see if i can get it fixed.
 
 Have fun!
